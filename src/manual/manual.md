# Manual

## Getting Started

### The Basics

This introduction will help you get your vNine dashboard up and running in no time.  
Once you've gotten your first pane tracking a symbol, you'll see just how easy it is to 
efficiently manage and gain insight into your symbol over time.

If you're worried about the programming aspect of EVNTScript, fear not, because 
throughout this documentation, you'll find many different bits of programming 
knowledge that will help you translate your predictions into code.

#### Pane Creation

To get started, simply drag a new pane into your vNine dashboard from the context menu 
on the left.

#### Opening the editor

Click the JS button to open up the Javascript style editor. 
You should be presented with an empty sample script corresponding to your new pane.  

It may seem daunting at first glance, but soon you'll come to find that nearly 
everything in this sample script is crucial for contructing your own.

### Declaring your Variables

Once you've opened your Javascript editor, you should see your main CEVNTPane and 
CEVNTFeed variables. These are foundational objects you're going to use most to 
maintain the feed of the symbol you're tracking.

```js
var gEvntPane;
var gPaneFeed;
var gFeedDraw;
var gSymbolName = "";
```

- [CEvntPane](../class/src/index.js~CEvntPane) ```gEvntPane```  
Your pane variable allows you to create just about everything else we're going to need 
to make use of your script.

[//]: # "Test whether or not this reference syntax works"

- [CEvntFeed](../class/src/index.js~CEvntFeed.html) ```gPaneFeed```  
Your feed variable will be used to track and make use of every single [Event](../class/src/index.js~Event.html) 
that has occured since the exchange last opened.

- [CEvntDraw](../class/src/index.js~CEvntDraw.html) ```gEvntDraw```  
Your draw variable will let you draw the feed you're tracking to your pane. This is useful 
for determining for yourself whether or not your script is properly handling the data it is 
receiving from your symbol.

- [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) ```kSymbolName```  
The symbol name is the technical name of the symbol we want to interpret.

#### Built-in Functions

##### onLoad

The built in onLoad function is called when the user clicks the run button shown below.  

<img src="asset/click_run.png" width="40%" height="40%">

It is extremely useful for setting up all of your variables perfectly before your script 
begins running through each and every event in the [onEvent](../function/index.html#static-function-onEvent) method.

[//]: # "Test whether or not this reference syntax works"

```js
function onLoad ()
{
    gEvntPane = MakePane();
    gPaneFeed = gEvntPane.MakeFeed(gSymbolName);
    gFeedDraw = gEvntPane.MakeDraw(gPaneFeed);	
}
```

- [MakePane](../function/index.html#static-function-MakePane) ```MakePane()```  
The built in function [MakePane](../function/index.html#static-function-MakePane) 
returns a new [CEvntPane](../class/src/index.js~CEvntPane.html) object. 
Most of the time, the above snippet included, it is used to set your ```gEvntPane``` variable 
to a new pane in the initialization of your script.

- [MakeFeed](../class/src/index.js~CEvntPane.html#instance-method-MakeFeed) ```gEvntPane.MakeFeed(gSymbolName)```  
Returns a new [CEvntFeed](../class/src/index.js~CEvntFeed.html) object 
based on your specified symbol name. If you pass in the same symbol name, this is equivilent to 
the feed that will be tracked in your 
[onEvent](../function/index.html#static-function-onEvent) method.

- [MakeDraw](../class/src/index.js~CEvntPane.html#instance-method-MakeDraw) ```gEvntPane.MakeDraw(gPaneFeed)```  
Returns a new [CEvntDraw](../class/src/index.js~CEvntDraw.html) object 
based on your newly created feed. This will render your feed in your pane.

##### onEvent

The built in onEvent function is called once for each timestamp tracked in your symbol.  

This is where you'll be doing most of your calculations on the specific things you're 
looking for in your symbol. It allows your script to perform different tasks depending 
on the current event's conditions.

```js
function onEvent (pFeed, pSequ)
{
	
}
```

- [CEvntFeed](../class/src/index.js~CEvntFeed.html) ```pFeed```  
A feed with timestamps measured in nanoseconds with 64 bit precision.

- [Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) ```pSequ```  
A number that is used for Amount of events within this sequence. It defaults to 0.

##### onOpen

The built in onOpen function is called once the pane has properly loaded and rendered the Symbol information.

It allows you to make any last minute changes once your script has successfully tracked each and every 
event in your symbol's feed.

```js
function onOpen ()
{
	
}
```

##### onStop

The built in onStop function is called when the user clicks the stop button shown below.

<img src="asset/click_stop.png" width="40%" height="40%">

This function can be useful for logging data gathered while the symbol was running.

```js
function onStop ()
{
	
}
```

## General Formatting

### Notation

Constants used for distinguishing variable roles

- `k` | K denotes a constant variable
- `g` | G denotes a global variable

```js
var gEvntPane;
var gPaneFeed;

```

## Enumerated Constants

### CEvntFeed.FeedStep

Constants used for CEvntFeed.FeedStep

gPaneFeed.FeedStep = kStepHide; //This will hide the current event in the feed
```
